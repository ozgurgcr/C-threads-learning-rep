//opening a device 

#include<fcntl.h>
const char device[] = "/dev/ttyUSB0";
fd = open(device, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);
if(fd == -1) {
  printf( "failed to open port\n" );
}

device  : the path to the serial port 
fd      : the returned file handle for the device. -1 if an error occured. 
O_RDWR  : opens the port for reading and writing 
O_NOCTTY: the port never becomes the controlling terminal of the process
O_NDELAY: Use non-blocking I/O. On some systems this also means the RS232 DCD signal line is ignored.

// close a device 

close(fd)

//serial device configuration
